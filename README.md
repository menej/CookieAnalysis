# CookieAnalysis



## Categorization

This project categorizes cookies based on their names. To achieve this, we use data from various open sources and websites.

We acknowledge that making multiple automated queries to these sources can contribute to traffic load. To mitigate this, we have implemented a throttling mechanism for categorization requests.

Used sources for categorization:
- Open Cookie Database: **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jkwakman/Open-Cookie-Database)**

- Cookiepedia: **[Website](https://cookiepedia.co.uk/)**
